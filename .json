Plus, you can access history, watch your videos, add them to Chromecast, download videos and much more! There are numerous categories to choose from and you will also be notified of new releases!

For the budget conscious customer, Pobreflix is the next best option! You can find thousands of free titles here, you just have to wait. This app finds all the links to these videos from the internet so you can easily access them all in one place.\nHistory and Favorites System\nTo keep things neat and tidy, this app lets you watch and watch movies. This is a great way to tell if you've already watched the videos. You can add some videos to your favorites list so you can watch them later. That way, you don't have to search for your videos frequently or find the videos you want to watch later.\nMark as viewed and notifications\nAnother feature is the ability to mark videos in this app. This is a great way to quickly see the latest episodes you've seen on the show, and more. In addition, you can be informed about new releases of movies and shows. How nice it is now you have to open the app manually every time to see if there are newer versions.\nDownload for offline Use\nAnother great thing is the ability to download videos for offline fly use! Pobreflix understands that we donâ€™t always have an internet connection. Because of this, they've included a download option that makes it easy for us to watch our favorite movies and shows.\nSimple user interface\nto combine it all together, the app's interesting and clear user interface gives you access to everything you need!",
